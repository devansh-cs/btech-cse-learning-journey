# Python Basics

This folder contains Python practice files created while learning the fundamentals of Python.
The code here reflects my step-by-step learning progress and understanding of core programming concepts.
- Logical comparisons
- Real-world problems like grading systems and vowel/consonant checks

## Structure

Each Python file focuses on **one core concept** and contains multiple small examples
to strengthen understanding without mixing unrelated topics.

Mini projects built using these concepts are stored separately in the `Mini-Projects` folder.

## Note

This code is written as part of my learning journey.
The implementations are beginner-friendly and will be improved as I learn more advanced concepts.
